<h6>I was born in Tomahawk, Wisconsin on April 24th, but<br>
when I was seven my family moved from Wisconsin to New Mexico.
There I attending Mosaic Academy, a public charter school, and eventually
attended Aztec High School, where I graduated with Honors.<br>

My parents split up in early high school, which brought on a lot of 
challenge in my family. I became an angry and spiteful teenager who 
reclused herself in her room and hated the world.

<h5>During this period of time, I didn't know who I wanted to be, or what career I wanted to go into.
It was then I was made aware of a college course I could take that was<br>
about the introduction to web development and graphic design.<br>
I fell in love with it immediately, and wanted to<br>
pursue web development as a whole. Hence why I moved here!<br>
My mom and my little brother still live in New Mexico, while<br>
my father and I live up here.</h5>

<h6>My goal for the future is to<br>
move to Denver, Colorado not only to be closer to my family<br>
and friends, but to also have access to<br>
a lot more job opportunities. I hope to be able to<br>
work for a large company there, but also have the ability<br>
to do freelance designing as well.
